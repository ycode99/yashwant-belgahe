## Expressive Graphic Layouts

Modern web design has moved beyond flat panels. Today's browsers give us the tools to simulate organic textures, layered paper sheets, and hand-drawn borders natively in stylesheet code, without requesting heavy raster assets.

In this guide, we'll review the CSS tricks behind our comic book aesthetic.

### 1. Skewed Panel Borders

Instead of boring grids, we can create skewed layouts by applying CSS `transform` properties or `clip-path`. In Tailwind v4, we can simply apply skew utilities:

```html
<div class="border-4 border-black skew-x-1 hover:skew-x-0 transition-transform duration-200">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### 2. Paper Weathering Noise

We can apply a realistic paper weathering filter using an inline SVG mask containing a `feTurbulence` noise generator. This is applied as a pseudo-element overlay on the entire viewport, creating a textured paper look:

```css
.paper-texture::before {
  content: "";
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
  opacity: 0.025;
}
```

### 3. Retro Halftone Prints

To achieve the classic color-screen dot matrix printing effect of early Marvel comics, we can overlay a custom radial-gradient background:

```css
.bg-halftone::after {
  background-image: radial-gradient(var(--foreground) 1px, transparent 1px);
  background-size: 16px 16px;
}
```

Using these three tricks, you can take a standard Next.js website and make it feel like a tactile print graphic novel.
